      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the
      Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. "Hypertext"
      refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a
      single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the
      Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created
      by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the
      presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects
      such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be
      rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

      JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled)
      programming language with first-class functions. While it is most
      well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser
      environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe
      Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, garbage-collected, dynamic
      language, supporting multiple paradigms such as imperative, functional,
      and object-oriented.

      ReactJS (or simply React) is an open-source JavaScript library that helps
      build user interfaces or UI components. Jordan Walke, a software engineer
      at Facebook, created ReactJS and first used it on Facebookâ€™s newsfeed in
      2011. Instagram started using it in 2012. React became public in 2013, and
      this started its path to becoming one of the most powerful front-end
      libraries in web development.
