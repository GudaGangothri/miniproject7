      SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language to operate databases; it
      includes Database Creation, Database Deletion, Fetching Data Rows,
      Modifying & Deleting Data rows, etc. SQL stands for Structured Query
      Language which is a computer language for storing, manipulating and
      retrieving data stored in a relational database. SQL was developed in the
      1970s by IBM Computer Scientists and became a standard of the American
      National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and the International
      Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.

      PostgreSQL is an enterprise-class open source database management system.
      It supports both SQL and JSON for relational and non-relational queries
      for extensibility and SQL compliance. PostgreSQL supports advanced data
      types and performance optimization features, which are only available in
      expensive commercial databases, like Oracle and SQL Server. It is also
      known as Postgres.

      MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data
      storage. Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational
      databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. Documents
      consist of key-value pairs which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB.
      Collections contain sets of documents and function which is the equivalent
      of relational database tables.
